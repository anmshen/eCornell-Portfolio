## Income Predicting Random Forest Model

### Objective: 
The goal of this project was to build a Random Forest model capable of classifying individuals based on whether their income falls below or surpasses a 50K threshold, using census data as features. The model's performance achieved an AUC score of 0.844.

### Data:
The data used is an adult income dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset).

### Dependencies:
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and SciPy were utilized for data pre-processing, constructing the model, and tuning hyperparameters.
